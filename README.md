# CMSE202_Honors_Project

#For this project I am going to be looking at a retirement fund of a neihgboorhood. Their retirements are going to change depending on differnt
#situations that they go through. It is unrealistic to think that you aren't going to need to pull from your retirement fund. The biggest reasons that people 
#make withdrawls are because they need a down payment for their house, they become unemployed, or they go through a divorce. The questions that I would like 
#to answer is which one of those three instances is going to impact the retirement fund the most and why? On top of that time has a huge role in a retirement fund 
#I would like to know when time has an affect and maybe when it doesn't. 

#To answer these questions I am going to model each of these situations using a class. The different neighboors are going to be the objects of that class, and 
#each situation is going to be a different instance of that class. Each person is going to be almost identical except for their specific situation (divorce, buying a 
#house, or being unemployed). They are all going to have a salary of 70,000, save 10% of their income, and put their money into a high yield savings account. With 
#a .5% APY (Annual percentage yield).
